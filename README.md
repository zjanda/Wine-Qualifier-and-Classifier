# Wine-Qualifier-and-Classifier

This program trains a neural network based on given wine data to predict color and a random forest to predict quality.

There are two sets of data: 
  1. Red Wine
  2. White Wine
 
Each wine has characteristics (features) and overall quality (target value). 

The program trains two models: 
  1. Predict quality of the wine. (Random Forests)
  2. Predict color of the wine. (Neural Network)
